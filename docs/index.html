                    <p>Hi!ðŸ‘‹
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am Ashita, pronounced aa-shi-ta.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am a student completing my Master of Data Science degree from the University of British Columbia.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am passionate about using data to drive positive change and am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My passion for data is driven by a desire for transparency and evidence-based decision-making. I believe that using data to guide business decisions can lead to more informed strategies, ultimately benefiting both departments and the organization as a whole.

                    <p>Here's another paragraph of content. You can add as many paragraphs as you'd like, and they'll be scrollable.</p>

                    <p>This is a third paragraph demonstrating the scrolling functionality. The content will scroll while the left column remains fixed.</p>
