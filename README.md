Hi!ðŸ‘‹

I am Ashita, pronounced aa-shi-ta.

I am a student completing my Master of Data Science degree from the University of British Columbia. 

Before starting this program, I worked as a Business Systems Specialist in the Nonprofit and Post-Secondary sectors. My experience spans IT troubleshooting, software management, and business analysis, where I helped departments optimize their systems and processes.

My passion for data is driven by a desire for transparency and evidence-based decision-making. I believe that using data to guide business decisions can lead to more informed strategies, ultimately benefiting both departments and the organization as a whole.
