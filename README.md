# Credits

Now, credits where credits are due ü§ù

I used Adrian Hajdin's Javascript Mastery tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fYi8SGA20k) to code this website. 

You can also find the github repository I used as reference [here](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_3D_developer_portfolio/tree/main)


Adrian has really good material on learning basics and advance levels of javascript and I would highly recommend checking hime out. Personally, I was curious about the timeline and rotating logos which is what motivated to create my own website. 

Another credit goes to ChatGPT which helped me a lot in debugging.
